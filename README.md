My personal list of useful Rust docs and crates.

## Cli 

 * [structopt](https://crates.io/crates/structopt) â€” Parse command line argument by defining a struct

## Configuration

  * [dotenv](https://crates.io/crates/dotenv) - This library is meant to be used on development or testing environments in which setting environment variables is not practical.

## Error handling

 * [snafu](https://crates.io/crate/snafu) - SNAFU is a library to easily assign underlying errors into domain-specific errors while adding context.
